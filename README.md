# SWSI-Tafe
Hello my friends, my name is Ravneel Prasad.

I was raised in de_Indian_village and then was exiled to a path of de_wrayclast i was the most powerful shadow/ninja/assassin of all the other exiles. My DPS was 90,000,000K and was rank 100 in all PVP matches. I gathered all my gear from farming ledge in act 1 merciless along with some help from fellow shadows. The legend is told that i must one day return to my village de_Indian_Village and slay the dark lord farzin and his army of Chin Chin’s with the assistance of duel wielding COLEman blades. One of the most powerful duel wielding daggers in all of de_universe.☻
